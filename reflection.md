- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
This class represents a scinario where the player gets invited to a Primary School reunion, where they are to dig up a time capsule. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
None
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I looked at the lists of methods we are to use, came up with a story first, and then started writing the code. I'm interested in seeing what other stories other people in the class came up with!
